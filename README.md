# Ty's Ports Manager

A helper application for setting the appropriate Wine resolution and other values related to the graphics settings. This allows the average user to know how to set things such as the resolution without knowing how to configure Wine

Ty's Port Manager (a Wineskin custom configuration utility) is a unified launcher app that works for with the Mac ports I release, including the public releases for BFME 1, 2 and ROTWK (tylero056 is my Reddit username).

**This utility provides the following:**

- Easily install mods

- Install/update patches on the Mac version (using standard Windows *.exe and *.msi installers)

- Tweak settings without having to dig through Wine/Wineskin's messy config files to change things, which is often not permitted by default
